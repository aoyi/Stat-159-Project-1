# Conclusion

It took me about 5 hours in total to finish the project and an extra hour for proofreading and adjusting minor mistakes in order to cover all points specified in the project requirement. Resources I looked at mainly include the Wikipedia page, Quora inquiry pages, the manual on the official website for each tool and some concepts introduced in the lecture. 


In conclusion, this is a very interesting project to work on. After reading through relevant resources and getting real experience to generate a reproducible report, I have a more comprehensive understanding about the importance of reproducibility, especially in the academia field. All the tools introduced in this project serve as great starting points and common techniques to move towards the direction of reproducible research.
